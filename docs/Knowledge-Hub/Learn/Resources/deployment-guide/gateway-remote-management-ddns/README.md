# Gateway Remote Management - DDNS

## Overview

This tutorial describes on how to use the fast and simple Dynamic Domain Name System (DDNS) Service to access the RAK Industrial Gateways. 

Several points must be taken into considerations:

* For accessing the Gateway behind a router, you have to consult with your router documentation in order to implement Port Forwarding or Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), so you can remotely access your Gateway.

* For accessing the Gateway, when connected through an LTE network, please contact your cellular service provider in order to implement Port Forwarding.
