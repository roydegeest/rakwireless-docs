# Gateway-A with Built-in LoRa® NS

This section is the detailed discussion on how to set-up the built-in LoRa® Server for your RAK7258 Micro Outdoor Gateway using the Web Management Platform.

We will first set-up the built-in LoRa®  network server. Before going through the steps, access the Web Management Platform as discussed in the prior section.

## Packet Forwarder Set-up

:::tip Note
:pencil: For other settings and detailed documentation for this section, kindly browse the [LoRaWAN Gateway Configuration](../web-management-platform/lora-network-server.html#_2-general) section.
:::

1. By navigating through LoRa® Gateway tab-> LoRa® Packet Forwarder-> General Setup, set the Protocol in the drop-down list to **Build-in LoRa ® Server**.

2. You can leave the rest of the settings with their default values. Remember to "**Save & Apply**".

2. By pressing the "**Add**" button, you will be redirected into a new tab where you will need to fill the mandatory parameters: **Name** and **Description**.

3. If everything is set-up correctly, you should see the same set-up with the image shown below:

:::tip Note
:pencil: In order to see the Last Seen status update you need to refresh the page. There should be a value of a couple of seconds, if so than everything went well. In case there is a message **Never Seen**, there is an issue and you best redo the configuration.
