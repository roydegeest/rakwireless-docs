# Gateway Built-in LoRa® NS
This document is the detailed discussion on how to set-up the built-in LoRa® Server for your RAK7249 Marco Outdoor Gateway using the Web Management Platform.

We will first set-up the built-in LoRa®  network server. Before going through the steps, access the Web Management Platform as discussed in the prior section.

3. If everything is set-up correctly, you should see the same set-up with the image shown below:

:::tip 📝 NOTE
 In order to see the Last Seen status update you need to refresh the page. There should be a value of a couple of seconds, if so than everything went well. In case there is a message **Never Seen**, there is an issue and you best redo the configuration.
