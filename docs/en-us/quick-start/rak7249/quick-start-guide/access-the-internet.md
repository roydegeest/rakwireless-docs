## Connect through Wi-Fi

:::tip Note:
:pencil: Assuming you have entered the correct parameter values you should get an IP address assigned by your Wi-Fi router's (AP) built-in DHCP server. You can use this new IP address to log in via a web browser (same way as in AP mode).

## Connect through Ethernet/PoE

Connect the **Ethernet Port (ETH)** of the RAK7249 Macro Outdoor Gateway via an Ethernet cable to your **Router**. The router’s DHCP server should assign an IP Address to the Gateway. You can change the default settings below if you wish (details in the User Manual).
