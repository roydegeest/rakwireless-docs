# Electrical Characteristics

Exceeding the device's rating on one or more listed in the Absolute Maximum Rating section may cause permanent damage. These are stress ratings only. Operating the module at these or at any conditions other than those specified in the Operating Conditions sections of the specification should be avoided. Exposure to Absolute Maximum Rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability. The operating condition range define those limit within which the functionality of the device is guaranteed. Where application information is given, it is advisory only and does not form part of the specification.

## Absolute Maximum Rating

Limiting values given below are in accordance with the Absolute Maximum Rating System (**IEC 134**)

| Symbol | Description | Condition | Min. | Max. | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| 3.3Vaux | Module supply voltage | Input DC voltage at 3.3Vaux pins | –0.3V | 3.6V | 
| USB | USB D+/D- pins | Input DC voltage at USB interface pins |  | 3.6V | 
| RESET | RAK2247 reset input | Input DC voltage at RESET input pin | –0.3V | 3.6V | 
| SPI | SPI interface | Input DC voltage at SPI interface pin | –0.3V | 3.6V | 
| GPS_PPS | GPS 1 pps input | Input DC voltage at GPS_PPS input pin | –0.3V | 3.6V | 
| Rho_ANT | Antenna ruggedness | Output RF load mismatch ruggedness at ANT1 |  | 10:1 VSWR | 
| Tstg | Storage Temperature |  | –40°C | 85°C | 



:::warning
:warning: The product is not protected against over voltage or reversed voltages. If necessary, voltage spikes exceeding the power supply voltage specification, given in table above, must be limited to values within the specified boundaries by using appropriate protection devices

## Operating Temperature

The table below lists the operation temperature range

| Parameter | Min. | Typical | Max. | Remarks | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| Normal operating temperature | -40°C | +25°C | +85°C | Normal operating temperature range (fully functional and meet 3GPP specifications) | 


:::tip Note:
:pencil: Unless otherwise indicated, all operating condition specifications are at an ambient temperature of 25u00b0C. Operation beyond the operating conditions is not recommended and extended exposure beyond them may affect device reliability.
