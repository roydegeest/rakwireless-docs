The SX1301 digital baseband chip contains 10 programmable reception paths. These
paths have different levels of programmability and has a variety of cases. It is
important to understand the differences between those demodulation paths to make the
best possible use from the system.

### Power Supply

RAK2245 Stamp Edition - LPWAN Gateway Concentrator Module is powered through 5V. It integrates the IOREF for
Level Translator, which can communicate with 3.3V, 1.8V and other different voltage
interfaces.

### SPI Interface

The pin connector provides an SPI connection which allows direct access to the Sx1301 SPI interface. This gives the target system the possibility to use existing SPI interfaces to communicate with the module.

::: tip 📝 NOTE
Please reset SX1301 via PIN A13 after turning on your RAK2245 Stamp Edition - LPWAN Gateway Concentrator Module

### UART and I²C

UART and I²C connections are also included on the pin connector. These connections allow direct access to the GPS module. The 1PPS is connected internally to SX1301.

### Digital IOs

There are two digital IO PINs, which give the user an interface to reset the GPS module or set it into standby mode.

### LEDs

3 x Green LED for indicating the status of PWR, TX, RX.

### Antenna RF Interface

The modules have two RF interfaces for LoRa® and GPS antennas over the standard UFL connectors (Hirose U. FL-R-SMT). It has a characteristic impedance of 50 Ω and supports both Tx and Rx via RF ports, providing the antenna interface.
