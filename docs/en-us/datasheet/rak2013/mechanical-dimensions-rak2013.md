# Mechanical Dimensions

Here is the detailed dimension of RAK2013 module. For full specification including electrical requirements, please visit this [**site**](https://github.com/raspberrypi/hats).

**Minimum HAT requirements**:

* The board must be 65 x 56 mm or 65 x 56.5 mm.
* The board must have 3 mm radius corners.
* It must have 4 mounting holes in corners and should follow mounting hole specifications.
* The board must have full 40W GPIO connector.

**Mounting Holes specifications**:

* Mounting holes should ideally non-plated. If plated, hole and grounding must be electrically isolated. (Do not connect these to GND)
* Mounting hole ground should be 6.2 mm minimum and either isolated copper or bare board (open solder mask).
* Mounting holes should be drilled to 2.75 ± 0.5 mm.

:::tip Note:
:pencil: It is recommended to provide slots or cutouts for camera and display flexes so camera and display can still be used with the HAT attached.
