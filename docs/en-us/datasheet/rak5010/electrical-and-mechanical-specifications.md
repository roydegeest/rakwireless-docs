## Electrical and Mechanical Specifications 

### Absolute Maximum Ratings

Stresses above those listed as “**absolute maximum ratings**” may cause permanent damage to the device. This is a stress rating, functional operation of the device under these conditions is not advised. Exposure to maximum rating conditions may affect device reliability.

|               Ratings               | Maximum Value (V) |
| :---------------------------------: | :---------------: |
|   Vbus, power supply on UBS port    |    -0.3 - 5.5     |
|        Vbat, battery voltage        |    -0.3 - 4.3     |
|      Vconn solar panel voltage      |    -0.3 - 5.5     |
|         IOs of J-link (J9)          |    -0.3 - 1.9     |
| IOs of BG96, nRF52840 - J10 and J12 |    -0.3 -VREF     |
|                 ESD                 |       2000        |

:::warning ⚠️ WARNING
The RAK5010, as any electronic equipment, is sensitive to electrostatic discharge (ESD), improper handling can cause permanent damage to module.

### Environmental Requirements

The table below lists the operation and storage temperature requirements:

|        Parameter        |  Min   | Typical |  Max   |
| :---------------------: | :----: | :-----: | :----: |
| Operational Temp. Range | -35 ºC | +25 ºC  | +75 ºC |
|  Extended Temp. Range   | -40 ˚C | +25 ºC  | +80 ˚C |
|   Storage Temp. Range   | -40 ˚C | +25 ºC  | +80 ˚C |


### Current Consumption

|                           Conditions                            | Current |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------: | :-----: |
|  The nRF52840 is Running, the BG96 transmits data @ NB1, 23dBm  | 200 mA  |
|     BLE transmits @ 0dBm, the BG96 is in power saving mode      |  7 mA   |
| The nRF52840 is in sleep mode, the BG96 is in power saving mode |  13 µA  |

:::tip 📝 NOTE
For the above results to be reached, the nRF52840's regulator has to be in DC-DC mode and all the sensors have to be in sleep mode.
