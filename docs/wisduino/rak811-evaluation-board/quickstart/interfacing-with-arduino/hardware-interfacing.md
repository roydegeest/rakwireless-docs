# Hardware Interfacing

In this document, we will be using an Arduino MEGA 2560 and RAK811 LPWAN Evaluation Board. Follow the steps thoroughly; any negligence might end up damaging your hardwares.

::: tip 📝 NOTE
As of now, our RAK811 LPWAN Evaluation Board only works with Arduino Mega 2560. Watch out for our future revisions for you to interface it with other Arduino boards.
:::

1. To start with, we are going to differentiate the existing RAK811 LPWAN Evaluation Boards or as named in the boards as WisNode-LoRa®.

::: tip 📝 NOTE
The five wires are connected in the same way with WisNode v1.1 and WisNode v1.2.
