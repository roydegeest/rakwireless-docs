### Checking Device Logs

You can check the logs for debugging purposes on your RAK8212 iTracker Pro through **J-link RTT Viewer**

#### Through J-link RTT Viewer

1. If you want to check the logs of RAK8212 iTracker Pro using this method, make sure you have connected the RAK8212 with your PC through JTAG like the following diagram below:

::: warning ⚠️ WARNING
You still have to connect the battery to the RAK8212 to power the board.
:::

2. Go to the Official Website of **Segger** where you can Download the [J-Flash software](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/tools/j-flash/about-j-flash/). Open the program “**J-Link RTT Viewer V6.60f**” and choose "**USB**" for the type of connection to J-Link. After which, press "**OK**".

### Configuring your RAK8212 iTracker Pro

You can configure your RAK8212 iTracker Pro by sending AT Commands through Bluetooth.

::: tip 📝 NOTE
For the complete list of AT Commands available for configuring your RAK8212 iTracker Pro, kindly check the [AT Commands for iTracker Pro](/wistrio/rak8212/quickstart/#at-commands-for-rak8212-itracker-pro) section.
:::

#### Through BLE

1. In order to configure the RAK8212 iTracker Pro through BLE, download and install **nRF Connect** which is developed by Nordic Semiconductor and is also available in both App Store and Google Play Store.

  width="100%"
  caption="nRF Connect App in Android and IOS"
/>

2. Make sure the Bluetooth on your mobile is turned on. Open the application and you will see all BLE devices in range in the scan list:

  width="50%"
  caption="nRF Master Control Panel (BLE) device connecting"
/>

3. Upon connecting, a pop-up window displays and in the third item "**Nordic UART Service**", click the arrow marked in the red box which enables you to write commands through **BLE**.

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak8212/quickstart/configuring-your-rak8212/piminlwoxlxa2lcyzjpx.jpg"
  width="100%"
  caption="AT+command sending throught BLE"
/>

4. Click the arrow which is marked by the red box in the picture below, you will see the following page:

  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak8212/quickstart/configuring-your-rak8212/xfvjlkpzlwvftkgsoaku.jpg"
  width="50%"
  caption="Nordic UART Service RX Characteristics"
/>

5. You can now then send AT commands to the RAK8212 iTracker Pro. Meanwhile, you can also see log information in RTT Viewer as discussed in [Checking Device Logs](/wistrio/rak8212/quickstart/#checking-device-logs) section.

- For example, if you want to check the current firmware’s version send the following command:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak8212/quickstart/configuring-your-rak8212/pygfdyws2p5zb5zsrtva.jpg"
  width="100%"
  caption="AT+command for RAK8212 Firmware Version"
/>

6. Then, you can see the version number in RTT Viewer tool:

  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak8212/quickstart/configuring-your-rak8212/ckpxkecc1jucumdjglfm.png"
  width="100%"
  caption="RAK8212 Firmware Version in RTT Viewer Tool"
/>

### Connecting to Cellular Network

This section is a sample guide on how to connect you RAK8212 iTracker Pro to a Cellular Network.

1. Insert a SIM Card into your RAK8212 iTracker Pro .

2. Make sure that your RAK8212 iTracker Pro is connected to your mobile device over BLE according to the [Configuring your RAK8212 iTracker Pro](/wistrio/rak8212/quickstart/#configuring-your-rak8212-itracker-pro) section.

3. Now, send `at+scan=cellular` from Mobile device over BLE to RAK8212 iTracker Pro as shown in the image below:

<rk-img
  src="/assets/images/wistrio/rak8212/quickstart/connecting-to-cellular-network/kzxbfaxur2zen98rb4c2.jpg"
  width="45%"
  caption="AT+command for scanning Cellular Network"
/>

4. Wait for about 20 seconds, and you should see some information similar to the image shown below in the RTT Viewer:

/>

::: tip 📝 NOTE
There may be several Cellular operator’s network signal detected upon scanning. In this section, the cellular networks available are CHINA MOBILE and CHN-UNICOM Cellular network.
