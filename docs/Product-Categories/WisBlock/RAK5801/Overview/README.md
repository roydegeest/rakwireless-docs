# RAK5801 WisBlock WisIO Module

## Product Description

The RAK5801 module is part of the WisBlock series that belongs to the WisIO category. This module is designed to be part of a production-ready IoT solution in a modular way and must be combined with a WisCore and a WisBase module. 

The RAK5801 is a **4-20mA current loop extension module** that allows the users to provide IoT solutions to analog sensors with a 4-20mA interface. This module converts the 4-20mA current signal into voltage range supported by the WisCore module (MCU) for further digitalization and data transmission

The RAK5801 module features **two input channels of 4-20mA**. Inside, high precision operation amplified is used, which supports a wide range of operating temperatures for the signal amplification and conversion. 

Also, this module integrates a **12V power supply**, which can be used by users to power the external sensors. The RAK5801 can be connected to a 2-wire or 3-wire or 4-wire types of 4-20mA sensor. The connection of the 4-20mA sensors is done through the fast crimping terminals without the need for special tools, which simplify the installation process on the fields.
