# RAK5005-O WisBase Board Datasheet

## WisBlock Overview

**WisBlock modules** are part of a series of stackable boards built by RAKWireless for the IoT industry. WisBlock modules support dozens type of CPUs, sensors, and interface circuit boards. This concept allows customers to build their own electronic solutions very quickly, using building blocks to materialize their new ideas. Also, through high-speed connectors and easily attachable interconnections, customers will be able to composite reliable industrial products.

WisBlock series are divided into four modules: **WisBase**, **WisDuo**, **WisSensor**, and **WisIO** modules.

**RAK5005-O** module falls in the category of WisBase module. It is the **motherboard of WisBlock** that allow to attach a CPU, sensor, and IO modules through the standardized expansion connectors. These connectors provide a data bus interconnection between the modules attached to the baseboard. Also, the WisBase module integrates the power supply circuitry for battery charging, USB ports, indicator LEDs, buttons, and extended IO interfaces.

WisDuo module is the core computing and wireless connectivity unit within the WisBlock series. It integrates an MCU, a LoRa, a BLE, and other wireless transceiver modules in a single package. The data collected by sensors are processed by the MCU and sent to the cloud through LoRa wireless links. The BLE interface can also be used for short-range communication and indoor positioning function.

The WisSensor module integrates **MEMS sensors** of different types. Each WisBase base board can support up to four WisSensor modules. Customers can combine different types of sensors for their specific solutions. Sensors on WisSensor are designed for low power consumption to extend battery life.

WisIO module adds more flexibility to customers’ solutions. It expands various application interfaces, such as industrial sensor interface, display interface, industrial communication protocol extension, buttons, and LED indicators, which can be quickly implemented with a WisIO module.

If the above is not enough to cover all the customers’ IoT requirements, WisBlock supports open-source hardware architecture. Therefore, users can also use the standard connectors of WisBlock to develop their specific function modules. Basing on the standard of WisBlock, customers can quickly develop their own products to meet the specific needs in different industries.

WisBlock series boards are not only a good choice for functional prototyping during the development and verification stages, but also allows the customers to create a reliable and stable industrial level of products for mass production.

WisBlock uses a compact and stackable hardware design, which integrates various computing, connectivity, and sensor circuits within a size of 60*30mm. The compact size makes it easy for users to build in various customized housings to achieve complete products. RAK also has a series of housings for WisBlock modules, which can meet the requirements of various protection levels.

## Specifications

### Overview


The RAK5005-O baseboard,as shown in Figures 4 and 5, has one slot reserved for WisDuo module, four slots for WisSensor modules and one slot for WisIO module. Also, there are also **2.54 mm pitch connectors** for extension interface, such as **I2C**, **UART**, and **GPIO pins**.

For convenience, there is a USB connector for debugging, it is connected directly to MCU’s USB port (if supported). The customer can access the internal MCU by connecting to a computer’s USB port directly. This USB connector is also used as a battery charging port.

Each module has method designed to connect and fasten the module easily. These connectors are **high-speed board to board connector**, they provide signal integrity for each data bus. A set of screws are used for attaching the module under the environment with vibrations.

To avoid electromagnetic interference and heating interference, the sensor connectors on the WisBase are designed to be installed on both sides of the PCB. As shown in figures 4 and 5, a sensor module can be attached either on the top layer or the bottom layer of the WisBase board.

For example, it is recommended to attach a temperature sensor outside of the base board, as shown in the Figure 7. It allows to get more accurate measurements, since temperature sensor located in the top layer of the base board could be interfered by the heating introduced by other modules.

  width="100%"
  caption="RAK5005-O WisBase Data Bus"
/>

The MCU module exposes the I2C, UART, and SPI data bus to the sensor modules. Through these buses, the CPU can retrieve data from the sensor and also control the sensors. In addition, USB, GPIO, and ADC ports are also connected to the IO module, which allows the customer to access all of the MCU interfaces on the IO board.

Some type of MCU has fewer IO pins. In such cases, not all the pins of the data bus are connected. For example, only I2C and UART are connected. Some MCU’ IO has an alternate function. You can modify its function by software or rework the hardware to redefine the function of IO. Refer to the datasheet of WisDuo to get the detail.


##### Power Supply Diagram of RAK5005-O

<rk-img

  width="100%"
  caption="Power Supply Block Diagram"
/>

The RAK5005-O is designed to be powered by a battery and provides the charger circuitry for a **lithium battery**. The charger circuitry can be connected to a wall outlet charger through the micro USB connector, or through the specific connector for the solar panel.

A low quiescent current LDO is used for generating **3.3V**, the 3.3V power supply drives MCU module (WisDuo) and IO module (WisIO) directly. The max current supported by the 3.3V LDO on RAK5005-O is **750mA**, it can drive MCU, LoRa, and MEMS sensor.

The VDD is generated by the MCU module to drive sensor and IO modules. The MCUs are usually powered by the 3.3V, and can provide different levels of voltage: **3.3V**, **2.5V**, and **1.8V** to their IO pins through regulators in the WisDue board. 

The 3V3_S is another 3.3V power supply. It can be controlled by the MCU in order to disconnect the power sensors during an idle period to save power. 3V3_S is controlled by the IO2 pin on the WisDueo board. 

- Set **IO2=1**, 3V3_S is on.
- Set **IO2=0**, 3V3_S is off.

:::tip 📝 NOTE
The RAK5005-O, as any electronic equipment, is sensitive to **electrostatic discharge (ESD)**. Improper handling can cause permanent damage to module.
:::

##### Current Consumption

The RAK5005-O designs for **low power IoT products** and the power supply use low grounding current regulator, when there is no module on RAK5005-O, the **leakage current is lower than 2µA**. With MCU and sensor on it, the sleep current is **lower than 10µA**. When the LoRa module is transmitting, the current may reach to **130mA**.

| **Conditions** | **Current** | **Unit** | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| Leakage current, without any module on RAK5005-O | 2 | µA | 
| Idle current, with MCU and sensor are in sleep mode | 10 | µA | 
| Working current, with LoRa module is transmitting | 130 | µA | 


##### Battery and Solar Panel Specification

The RAK5005-O WisBase board can be powered by a battery, connected to the **P1 connector**. The nominal operating voltage of the battery should be within the range showed in the following table.

| **Minimum** | **Typical** | **Maximum** | **Unit** | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| 3.3 | 3.7 | 4.3 | V | 

<br>

If a rechargeable battery is used, the USB connector is used as a charging port. The voltage and current fed to the battery through the port should not exceed to its charging limits, as shown in the table below.

| **Parameter** | **Value** | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| Charging Voltage | 4.5 – 5.5V | 
| Charging Current | 500 mA | 

<br>

A suitable Li-Ion battery should have the following parameters as shown in the table below:

| **Parameter** | **Value** | 
| ---- | ---- | 
| Standard Voltage | 3.7V | 
| Chargine VOltage | 4.2V | 
| Capacity | As required | 
| Discharge current | At least 500mA | 


:::tip 📝 NOTE
If a non-rechargeable battery is connected to the RAK5005-O, rework the hardware by removing the R17 on the bottom of RAK5005-O to disconnect the charger circuit. Otherwise, the USB port with try to charge the battery, and will damage the non-rechargeable battery, might damage the board, and is considered a fire or explode hazard.
